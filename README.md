# Solidity template

This is a template for GitHub repos with Solidity smart contracts using Forge and Hardhat. This template is used by the LooksRare team for Solidity-based repos. Feel free to use or get inspired to build your own templates!

## About this repo

### Structure

It is a hybrid [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) repo that also requires [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/index.html) to run Solidity tests powered by the [ds-test library](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-test/).

> To install Foundry, please follow the instructions [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html).

### Run tests

- TypeScript tests are included in the `typescript` folder in the `test` folder at the root of the repo.
- Solidity tests are included in the `foundry` folder in the `test` folder at the root of the repo.

### Example of Foundry/Forge commands

```shell
forge build
forge test
